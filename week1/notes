>>> **INHERITANCE**

- extends keyword is used in java for inheritence.
- advantages:
    1. code reusability
    2. modularity

- Types of inheritence

    1. Single Inheritence
        - A single child class inherits from a single parent class.
                    +-----+
                    |  A  |
                    +-----+
                       ^
                       |
                    +-----+
                    |  B  |
                    +-----+

    2. Multi Level Inheritence
        - A child class inherits properties from a parent class which inturn inheris from another parent class.
                    +-----+
                    |  A  |
                    +-----+
                       ^
                       |
                    +-----+
                    |  B  |
                    +-----+
                       ^
                       |
                    +-----+
                    |  C  |
                    +-----+

    3. Hierarchial Inheritence
        - A single parent class is inherited by multiple child classes.
                    +-----+
                    |  A  |
                    +-----+
                    ^      ^
                   /        \
            +-----+           +-----+
            |  B  |           |  C  |
            +-----+           +-----+

    4. Multiple Inheritence
        - A child class inheritss from multiple parent classes.
        - In Java it is not possible to implement Multiple Inheritence through classes. So we use interfaces
            +-----+          +-----+
            |  B  |          |  C  |
            +-----+          +-----+
                  ^         ^
                   \       /
                    +-----+
                    |  A  |
                    +-----+
        - There will be ambiguity if we implement multiple inheritence using classes
        ex: class B has run() method and class C also has run() method.
        now class A inheris both class B and class C 
        lets say class A also has run() method. now this run() has to override the run() in parent class. But there are multiple parent classes with same method signatures. so there will be ambiguity.

        - but this multiple inheritence using classes is possible in C++.


>>> **Polymorphism**

- it is a core OOP concept.
- "poly" means many,"morph" means forms.
- two types 
    1. Compile time (Method OverLoading)
        - Compile time polymorphism or method overloading
        - same name different signature
    2. Run time (Method OverRiding)
        - child classes overrides its parent class methods with same signature 

- Advantages:
    1. allows code resusability
    2. makes code more flexible and maintainable
    3. supports extensibility - new classes can be added.

 >>> __Abtraction__

 - key concept of OOP
 - Hiding internal implementation details and showing only the essentail features of an object.

 - _Why we need it ?_
    1. It reduces complexity
    2. to increase code reusability
    3. focus on what an object does instead of how it does it.

- we can acheive abstraction in java using
    1. Abstract Classes
    2. Interfaces

>> 1. Abstract Class
- declared with  with abstract keyword.
- can have both abstract methods(method without body) and concrete methods(method with body)
- cannot be instantiated

>> 2. Interface
- all methods are implicitly abstract and public
- it supports multiple inheritance
- from java 8 onwards we have 
            1. default
            2. static method
